BuildWatch
==========

This Android app shows build status information from the Continuous Integration server [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) on your Sony SmartWatch&trade; or Smart Wireless Headset pro &mdash; though if you have neither, you'll get notifications directly on your Android device.

The latest version can be downloaded from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crowflying.buildwatch&referrer=utm_source%3Dgithub%26utm_medium%3Dreadme%26utm_content%3Dapp), and further information can be found at [buildwatch.org](http://buildwatch.org/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=app).

Jenkins pushes updates to the app via Google Cloud Messaging &mdash; this requires the [GCM Notification Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GCM+Notification+Plugin).  
A setup guide is available at [buildwatch.org/setup.html](http://buildwatch.org/setup.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_content=app).

Have fun and please submit pull requests if you improve the app.

Thanks,  
Valentin
