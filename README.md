Buildwatch
==========

This Android Application shows build status information from the Contiuous Integration server Jenkins on your Sony SmartWatch(tm).

Detailed information can be found at http://www.buildwatch.org.

The app gets pushed updates via Google Cloud Messaging - it requires the jenkins gcm-notification-plugin. Setup Manual is available at http://ww.buildwatch.org/setup.html

Have fun and please submit pull requests if you improve the app.

Thanks,
Valentin
